# Bryan Tunis Portfolio
If i create a personal web portfolio, potential customers will be able to view my work, learn a little about me, and be able to contact me if they need.
My portfolio will consist of 3 main pages. 

The home page will be the first page the users see and it will give users the basic information about myself such as my name, experience, locations.

The Gallery Page will consist of mostly images of my finished work.  Im aiming to have at least two images of each of my works, 3 images for pieces that took me along time and i am proud of.  Along with some information about each piece such as materials and the titles.

The Contact page will be the third and final page for my portfolio.  This will have multiple ways to contact me such as phone number, email, mailing address, and various forms of my social media.  Also will connect my venmo link to my page for direct payment.  I would also like to include a messaging system directly from my webpage that allows users to send a message containing their name, email, and subject directly to my email so i dont have to check the webpage for new messages.
